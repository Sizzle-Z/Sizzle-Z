 <h1 style="font-size:10vw">Welcome to my Github!</h1> 

↳ Hi, I'm Sizzle. I am a experienced Lua developer, and I usually develop for FiveM.

↳ On my github, you will find many things to help protect your FiveM server from modders/cheaters, and also some things that will make your servers experience much more pleasent and smooth.

↳ I also may post some other stuff on my github like small things I have made in other coding languages such as python, and maybe JavaScript. This wont happen to often though.

↳ Alright! Thanks for looking at my profile! You can go check out my repo's at https://github.com/Sizzle-Z?tab=repositories
